## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v18 or later)
* **Python** (v3.11 or later)
* A package manager for Node.js (`npm` or `yarn`)
* An API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys)

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://your-repository-url.git](https://your-repository-url.git)
    cd your-project-directory
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv env
    .\env\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your Groq API key:
    ```env
    GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
    ```

5.  **Run the Backend Server**
    Open a terminal and run the following command. The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`.
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Open a New Terminal**
    Keep the backend server running in its own terminal. Open a second terminal for the frontend.

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Frontend Development Server**
    The frontend will start, usually on `http://localhost:5173`.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

---

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running:
1.  Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
2.  Fill out the questionnaire with your personal details and preferences.
3.  Submit the form. The application will send your request to the backend.
4.  The AI agent will generate your personalized meal plan, which will be displayed on the results screen.
